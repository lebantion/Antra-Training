Write queries for following scenarios

Use Northwind database. All questions are based on assumptions described by the Database Diagram sent to you yesterday. When inserting, make up info if necessary. Write query for each step. Do not use IDE. BE CAREFUL WHEN DELETING DATA OR DROPPING TABLE.

Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.

Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accept product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.

Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accept product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.

Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.

Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. (Make a screen shot) drop the table. Employee table should not be affected.

How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
